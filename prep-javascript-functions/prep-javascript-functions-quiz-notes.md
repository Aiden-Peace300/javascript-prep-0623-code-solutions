## Quiz Questions

After completing this exercise, you should be able to discuss or answer the following questions:

- What are the five parts of a function definition?
  - The function keyword: The function keyword is used to declare a function. It is the
    first part of a function definition and indicates that you are defining a function.
  - The function name: The name is used to identify the function and is followed immediately after
    the function keyword. It is used to refer to the function later when you want to call or invoke it.
  - Parameters: Parameters are placeholders for values that you can pass to a function when
    invoking it. They are enclosed in parentheses following the function name. You can define
    multiple parameters by separating them with commas.
  - Function body: The function body is enclosed in curly braces ({}) and contains the statements or
    code that defines what the function does. It is the block of code that will be executed when the
    function is called.
  - Return statement: The return statement specifies the value that the function should return when
    it is called. It is an optional part of a function definition. If a return statement is omitted,
    the function will still execute its code but will not return any value explicitly. If included, the
    function will terminate at the return statement and return the specified value.

- What is the difference between a parameter and an argument?
  Parameter: A parameter is a variable listed in the function's
  definition. It acts as a placeholder to represent the values
  that will be passed into the function when it is called.
  Parameters are defined within the parentheses in the
  function declaration.

  Argument: An argument, on the other hand, is the actual value that
  is passed into a function when it is called. It is the concrete
  value that corresponds to a specific parameter. Arguments are
  provided within the parentheses in the function call.
