## Quiz Questions

After completing this exercise, you should be able to discuss or answer the following questions:

- What is the principal use of arrays?
  The principal use of arrays in JavaScript is to store and manage
  collections of data. Arrays allow you to group related values together.

  One of the key advantages of arrays in JavaScript is their ability to
  store values of different types, such as numbers, strings, objects,
  and even other arrays. This flexibility allows you to create complex
  data structures and organize your data efficiently.

- Describe the syntax (structure) of array-literals in JavaScript.
  An array literal is represented by square brackets [].
  Inside the brackets, you can list the elements of the array
  separated by commas. Each element can be of any data type
  (e.g., numbers, strings, objects, other arrays, etc.).

- How can you access the last element of an array?
  To access the last element of an array in JavaScript, you can use the
  index position of myArray.length - 1. By subtracting 1 from the length
  of the array, you get the index representing the last element.
