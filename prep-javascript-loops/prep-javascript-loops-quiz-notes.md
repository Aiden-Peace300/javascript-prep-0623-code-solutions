## Quiz Questions

After completing this exercise, you should be able to discuss or answer the following questions:

- What is the purpose of the **condition** expression in the `for` and `while` loops?
  ANSWER: The condition expression in for and while loops determines when the loop should stop
  executing. It evaluates to either true or false, and as long as it's true, the loop continues.
  Once it becomes false, the loop terminates. It controls the repetition of the loop's
  execution based on a specified condition.

  ANSWER: The condition expression in a for loop is evaluated before each iteration to determine if the
  loop should continue or terminate.

- When is the third expression in the parentheses for a `for` loop (known as the **final expression**) evaluated?
  ANSWER: The final expression in a for loop is evaluated after each iteration, before the condition is checked again.
